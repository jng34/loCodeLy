and suggests cafes & coffee shops for them to meet up and code

Deliverables
 -Find shortest path from zip1 to zip2  ✔
 -Find all zip codes in shortest path between zip1 and zip2 ✔

 -Find an API to gather all cafes/coffee shops in specific zip codes



 /*
  TODO
  -Function works but only gives one absolute path that depends on 
  our graph inputs.
  -Need to find all Paths by maybe creating a second map of zips to 
  modify the distances
  -Finish the backtracking function to return the path of all zips
